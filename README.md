# Jekyll posts to JSON data

This is a personal mini project for export all Jekyll posts from my "Food Diary Blog" into a JSON file.

## Note

**Don't use this exactly script on your Jekyll blog, It is not compatible.**  
This is a personal project, if you know Ruby, feel free to modified the code on your own need.   
This code get all tags from Jekyll, but the content of every posts will not copy (for now).  

I am building a general script for export Jekyll to JSON in a future, stay tuned!
